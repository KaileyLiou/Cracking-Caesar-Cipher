# Cracking Caesar's Cipher

This is another python program that cracks the Caesar cipher using brute-force. I struggled with creating a playable link, but I eventually figured out how to make the release and run it on Terminal.

## How to Run on macOS

1. Download the chatbot file from the "Releases" section (assets â†’ main)
2. Open Terminal
3. Run these commands:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
chmod +x main
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine main
./main
